### Deploying the Website

To deploy this website and make it publicly accessible, you can follow these steps:

1. **GitHub Pages:**
   - If your repository is hosted on GitHub, you can leverage GitHub Pages to deploy your site directly from the `main` branch. Go to your repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and choose the `main` branch as the source.

2. **Custom Domain:**
   - If you have a custom domain, configure it in the GitHub Pages settings for your repository. Follow GitHub's documentation on [configuring a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

3. **Adjustments for Production:**
   - Ensure that your server configuration is suitable for a production environment. This may include securing sensitive information, setting up HTTPS, and configuring CORS. Refer to the documentation of your hosting provider for best practices.

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - If you're using environment variables for sensitive information (such as email credentials), make sure to securely configure them in your production environment. GitHub Pages, for instance, doesn't support server-side processing or handling of environment variables.

5. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test your deployed website to ensure all functionalities, including form submissions, work as expected in the production environment.

Feel free to customize these steps based on your specific deployment scenario. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation of the platforms you're using for more detailed guidance.
